# 🐍 Python Cheatsheet

Welcome to my **Python Cheatsheet** – a hands-on, beginner-friendly collection of Jupyter Notebooks created while working through the *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes and my personal learning journey. This repo is designed to serve as a quick reference and practical guide to core Python concepts, syntax, and coding patterns.

## 📚 Contents

This repository includes:

- 📓 Jupyter notebooks for each major topic
- ✅ Code snippets with explanations
- 💡 Tips and gotchas for beginners
- 🛠️ Examples and mini-projects

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Python basics (variables, data types, input/output)
- Control flow (if, while, for loops)
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
- File handling
- Error handling
- Classes and OOP
- Working with APIs
- Projects (e.g., simple games, data visualization)

> All content is written in **Jupyter Notebooks** for an interactive learning experience.
